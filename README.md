## Objective  
Currently, case predictions rely solely on the specifics of the ongoing case, often limiting the scope and accuracy of these forecasts. With the proposed implementation, predictions will become significantly more informed and reliable. By referencing and analyzing patterns from a database of similar past cases, this system will enable more educated and data-driven predictions. This shift from isolated assessments to pattern-based forecasting will provide decision-makers with deeper insights.

## Overview of Process  
The prediction process will leverage both the details of the main case and patterns derived from similar cases to provide more accurate and informed predictions. Hereâ€™s how the process will work:  

1. **Embedding Case Summaries**:  
   - The system will transform case summaries into numerical representations (embeddings). These embeddings capture the essential characteristics and details of each case in a format suitable for computational analysis.  

2. **Finding Similar Cases**:  
   - The database of case embeddings will be queried to identify the top three cases most similar to the main case.  
   - Similarity will be determined using algorithms such as cosine similarity, which measures the closeness of the embeddings.  

3. **Prediction Generation**:  
   - After identifying the top three similar cases, the system will analyze their outcomes and extract patterns.  
   - These patterns will serve as a foundation for predicting the likely outcome of the main case.

## Embedding Process  
The embedding process transforms textual case summaries into machine-readable numerical representations to facilitate similarity analysis and informed predictions. This approach leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive semantic insights and improve case management.  

### Preprocessing Case Summaries  
- **Refer to**: `embed.py/embed_sections()`  
- **Section Identification**: Case summaries are divided into distinct sections using predefined delimiters (e.g., `###` for headers). Each section is then analyzed individually.  
- **Title and Content Extraction**: The section's title is used as a key, while the remaining text (or list items) is designated as the content for further processing.  

### Generating Embeddings  
- **Refer to**: `embed.py/embed_sections()`  
- **Model Selection**: A pretrained transformer model, `all-mpnet-base-v2` from SentenceTransformers, is utilized to create embeddings. This model captures the semantic meaning of text and generates fixed-length numerical vectors.  
- **Content Handling**:  
  - **Paragraphs**: The content of the section is passed through the model to generate a single embedding.  
  - **Lists**: For content structured as lists (e.g., starting with `-` or numbered items), embeddings are generated for each item, and the mean of these embeddings represents the section.  

### Storing Embeddings  
- **Refer to**: `embed.py/save_embeddings()`  
- The embeddings are stored in a JSON file (`embeddings.json`), where each case is associated with its corresponding section embeddings.  
- Each embedding is saved as a list of floating-point numbers for efficient storage and retrieval.  

### Similarity Analysis  
- **Case-Level Comparison**:
    - **Refer to**: `embed.py/find_most_similar_cases()`  
    - **Metric Used**: Cosine similarity, which measures the closeness of two embeddings, is calculated. Values range from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating identical vectors.  
    - **Top Similar Cases**: The top N most similar cases (default is 3) are identified based on their average embedding similarity to the target case.  
- **Section-Level Comparison**:
    - **Refer to**: `embed.py/find_section_similarities()`  
    - For the most similar cases, section-level similarities are analyzed to identify patterns in specific areas of the case summary.  

---

## Reporting  
- **Refer to**: `script.log`  
- The process generates a similarity report that includes:  
  - The top similar cases and their similarity scores.  
  - Section-wise similarity scores for common sections.  
  - Sections that were not compared, if any.

## Embedding Case Summaries -vs- Embedding the Full Case  
Embedding case summaries strikes a balance between efficiency and accuracy. It reduces computational demands, ensures the focus remains on the critical aspects of the case, and provides meaningful and actionable insights in a scalable manner.  

1. **Focused Information Extraction/Noise Reduction**:  
   - Summaries distill the most relevant information about a case, such as the context, primary events, and outcomes. Embedding these summaries avoids processing extraneous details and focuses on the core content critical for prediction and similarity analysis.  
   - Embedding the entire case might include irrelevant or redundant details, such as procedural text or legal formalities, which can dilute the quality of the embeddings.  

2. **Computational Efficiency**:  
   - Embedding summaries requires less time, enabling faster predictions and quicker updates to the database when new cases are added.  
   - The final embedding of a case summary takes less storage than a full case embedding.  

3. **Improved Similarity Analysis**:  
   - Summaries standardize the information being compared, ensuring that similarity analysis focuses on the most important aspects of cases rather than being influenced by variations in case length or structure.
