### Case Summary

The case involving Johan highlights his challenges with academic performance and behavioral issues in school stemming from undiagnosed learning disabilities. Johan, a 12-year-old boy, has been struggling to keep up with his peers and has been exhibiting frustration and defiance in the classroom. His parents have sought intervention from educational professionals to assess his needs and to secure appropriate support services to help him succeed academically.

### Health-Related Issues
