The case involves 12-year-old Ravi, who is facing significant difficulties with his academic performance and social relationships due to suspected undiagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Ravi, an energetic and imaginative child, struggles to concentrate in class and often seems disorganized, which has negatively impacted his learning and peer interactions. His parents have sought guidance from educational and mental health professionals to evaluate his needs and secure the necessary resources to support his development.
