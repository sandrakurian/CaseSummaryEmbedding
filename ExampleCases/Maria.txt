# NOT A REAL CASE SUMMARY -- GENERATED WITH CHATGPT

### Case Summary

The case involves Maria, a 28-year-old mother, and her two children, ages 5 and 8, who fled their home due to repeated incidents of domestic violence perpetrated by her partner, James. Maria sought emergency shelter after an altercation that left her with visible injuries. The children witnessed the abuse, and their behavior has raised concerns about trauma. Intervention services are working to secure their safety and provide the necessary support.

### Health-Related Issues

Maria sustained physical injuries, including bruises and a fractured wrist, during the latest incident. She is receiving medical treatment but has also shown signs of emotional distress, including anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Both children exhibit symptoms of emotional trauma, such as nightmares, clinginess, and trouble concentrating at school. Counseling has been recommended for the entire family.

### Legal Issues

Maria has obtained a temporary protective order against James and is seeking legal assistance to make it permanent. James is under investigation for domestic violence, and criminal charges are being prepared. Custody arrangements are under review, with Maria seeking sole custody of the children for their safety.

### Financial Issues

Maria has no independent source of income, as she was financially dependent on James. She is struggling to meet basic needs and is applying for emergency assistance programs, including housing support and food stamps. Her inability to work due to her injuries has added to her financial strain.

The family is currently residing in a domestic violence shelter, but Maria lacks a stable support network.
