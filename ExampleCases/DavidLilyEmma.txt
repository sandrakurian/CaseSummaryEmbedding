### Case Summary

The case involves a single father, David, and his two teenage daughters, Lily (14) and Emma (16), who were reported to child protective services due to allegations of verbal and emotional abuse. The family has been struggling since David’s divorce two years ago, which led to significant financial and emotional instability. Tensions in the household have escalated, and both girls have shown signs of distress at school.
