### Case Summary

The case involving Igor focuses on his struggle with chronic homelessness and associated mental health issues. Igor, a 45-year-old man, has been living in temporary shelters and on the streets for several years, exacerbated by his untreated mental health conditions. Local social services have become involved to assist Igor in finding stable housing and access to necessary mental health resources.

### Health-Related Issues

Igor presents with symptoms of untreated schizophrenia and depression. He experiences auditory hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and significant mood swings, which contribute to his difficulties in maintaining stable housing. A comprehensive mental health evaluation has been recommended to confirm his diagnoses and to establish a treatment plan, which may include medication and therapy.

### Legal Issues

There are no current legal issues noted in Igor's case; however, his homelessness poses potential legal challenges, especially if he is arrested for trespassing or related offenses. Social services have advised Igor about his rights regarding housing assistance and have discussed pathways to secure benefits that he may not have previously accessed.

### Financial Issues

Igor is currently unemployed and lacking a source of income, which drastically limits his ability to afford housing or necessary healthcare. He qualifies for government assistance programs, but he has not yet completed the application process. Social workers are providing support to help him navigate these systems to secure financial aid.

### Social Issues

Igorâ€™s chronic homelessness has led to social isolation and difficulties in building connections with others.
