The case involves 11-year-old Amina, who is experiencing significant challenges with her academic performance and social interactions due to suspected undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Amina, a bright and creative child, has been struggling to relate to her peers and has faced difficulties in communication in the classroom. Her parents have decided to consult educational and psychological professionals to assess her needs and secure the appropriate resources to support her development and learning journey.

### Health-Related Issues

Concerns have been raised regarding Amina's communication skills and social interactions, leading to the suspicion of autism spectrum disorder.

A comprehensive evaluation by a child psychologist has been recommended to identify any underlying conditions and to develop an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) to promote her success in school.

### Legal Issues

Her parents are advocating for appropriate assessments and accommodations within the educational system to ensure that Amina receives the support she needs for an effective learning environment.

They are exploring community resources and non-profit organizations that could offer financial assistance to families with children requiring special educational support.
