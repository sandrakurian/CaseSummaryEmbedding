### Case Summary

This case involves Leo, a 16-year-old boy struggling with severe anxiety and adapting to a new city and school after his family’s move. Following the relocation, Leo’s anxiety escalated, leading to a decline in his academic performance and social withdrawal. His parents are actively seeking mental health support to help Leo navigate his feelings and improve his adjustment to his new environment.

### Health-Related Issues

Leo displays symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder, including intense fear in social situations, avoidance of speaking in class, and physical symptoms such as sweating and rapid heartbeat. He has difficulty sleeping due to racing thoughts about social interactions and consistently feels overwhelmed. A comprehensive mental health evaluation has been recommended to assess his needs, and therapy focused on cognitive-behavioral techniques is being sought to assist him in managing his anxiety.

### Legal Issues

Although there are no pressing legal issues in Leo's situation, his right to educational support is critical.
