# NOT A REAL CASE SUMMARY -- GENERATED WITH CHATGPT

### Case Summary

The case involves 45-year-old Maya and her 12-year-old daughter, Zara, who were brought to the attention of child protective services after neighbors reported ongoing domestic disputes and signs of neglect. Upon investigation, it was found that Maya has been battling alcohol use disorder, which has affected her ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment for Zara. As a result, Zara has been left unsupervised for extended periods, often having to fend for herself. Currently, Zara has been placed in a temporary foster home while Maya addresses her addiction issues and works towards rebuilding her parental capabilities.

### Health-Related Issues

Maya has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, leading to significant deterioration in her physical well-being, including liver issues and chronic fatigue. She displays erratic behavior tied to her drinking patterns. Zara has exhibited symptoms of anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and low self-esteem as a result of her neglectful home situation. Both are referred to healthcare professionals: Maya for alcohol rehabilitation and Zara for therapy to help cope with the emotional fallout of her experiences.

### Legal Issues

Child protective services (CPS) have taken temporary custody of Zara due to the neglect and unsafe living conditions that she was subjected to. Maya has been advised to complete a comprehensive alcohol treatment program and demonstrate that she can provide a safe and stable home environment before regaining custody. No criminal charges have been filed against Maya at this stage, but CPS is closely monitoring her compliance with the rehabilitation process. Failure to meet the established criteria may lead to a permanent custody hearing.

### Financial Issues

Maya's alcohol dependency has rendered her unable to maintain steady employment, leading to financial difficulties. She has accrued significant debt and is unable to pay for basic necessities, including rent and utilities. Currently, she is relying on sporadic financial help from friends, which is insufficient to support her and Zara's needs. Maya is actively seeking government assistance, including unemployment benefits and support for housing.

### Social Issues

Maya's alcohol use has led to a breakdown of her social network, resulting in isolation from friends and family, while Zara's social life has also been impacted. At school, Zara's emotional struggles have made it hard for her to connect with peers, and teachers have raised concerns about her behavior and performance. The foster home where Zara is currently placed offers her a stable environment, but it comes with challenges, as the foster parents are also facing their own financial hurdles.
