# NOT A REAL CASE SUMMARY -- GENERATED WITH CHATGPT

### Case Summary

The case involves 38-year-old Aarav and his 10-year-old son, Raj, who were referred to child protective services after teachers at Raj's school expressed concerns about his sudden weight loss, frequent absences, and signs of emotional distress. During an investigation, it was revealed that Aarav has been struggling with methamphetamine addiction, which has led to neglectful parenting and erratic behavior. Raj has been primarily caring for himself, with minimal supervision or emotional support from Aarav. Raj is currently staying with his aunt while Aarav seeks treatment and works to regain custody.

### Health-Related Issues

Aarav has been diagnosed with methamphetamine use disorder, and his addiction has severely impacted his physical and mental health. He exhibits signs of paranoia, weight loss, and poor hygiene. Raj has developed anxiety, sleep disturbances, and signs of emotional neglect, including withdrawal from social interactions and low academic performance. Both are referred to appropriate healthcare professionals: Aarav for addiction treatment and Raj for counseling to address his trauma and emotional issues.

### Legal Issues

Child protective services (CPS) have filed for temporary custody of Raj due to concerns about neglect and exposure to unsafe conditions. Aarav has been informed of the need to complete a substance abuse rehabilitation program and demonstrate stable living conditions before custody can be restored. While no criminal charges have been filed, CPS continues to monitor Aarav’s progress closely. If Aarav fails to meet the conditions set by CPS, the case could proceed to a permanent custody hearing.

### Financial Issues

Aarav is unemployed and has struggled to maintain consistent work due to his addiction. He has fallen behind on bills and rent, which has led to financial instability. His primary source of income is occasional assistance from friends and family, but it is not sufficient to support himself or Raj. Aarav is in the process of applying for government assistance, including housing support and food stamps.

### Social Issues

Aarav's addiction has caused him to become socially isolated, and he has limited contact with extended family and friends. Raj has been isolated as well, with minimal social interaction outside of school. His emotional and behavioral difficulties at school have strained his relationships with peers and teachers. Raj’s aunt, who has temporarily taken him in, is providing him with a more stable environment, but she is also facing financial strain as a result of taking on the responsibility.
